I chose Java for programming language. For linter Checkstyle, PMD, Sonalint commonly used. Tests are handled by JUnit, TestNG. And for build Maven and Gradle are most popular tools. 
Spacelift, GitLab CI, CircleCI are some alternatives for Jenkins and GitHub Actions.
If this application needs high security and complicated config requirements self-hosting would be necessery. Otherwise cloud-hosting CI/CD is better choice.
